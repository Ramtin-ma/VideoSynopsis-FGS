# Video Synopsis: FGS Model

## Overview
Video synopsis is a powerful technique for condensing long surveillance videos into a shorter summary, where key activities are preserved. The process involves detecting and tracking objects in a video, followed by creating "object tubes"â€”sequences of frames that encapsulate the movement of a particular object over time. These object tubes are then rearranged to maximize the visibility of non-overlapping objects in each frame, resulting in a condensed version of the original video. This technique is particularly useful for applications such as security surveillance, where reviewing hours of footage quickly is crucial.

## Features
- **FGS Model**: Fast and efficient video synopsis generation.
- **Empty-Frame Object Detector**: Identifies frames without any objects to optimize the object detection process.
- **Tube Grouping Algorithm**: Maintains relationships among object tubes.
- **Greedy Tube Rearrangement**: Efficiently determines the start time for each object tube.

- ## SynoClip Dataset
The **SynoClip** dataset is a comprehensive and standard dataset specifically designed for the video synopsis task. It consists of six videos, each ranging from 8 to 45 minutes in length, captured from outdoor-mounted surveillance cameras. This dataset is meticulously annotated with tracking information, making it an ideal resource not only for video synopsis but also for related tasks such as object detection in videos and multi-object tracking.

### Key Features:
- **Diverse Video Lengths**: Includes six videos with varying lengths, ranging from 8 to 45 minutes, providing a variety of scenarios for testing.
- **Outdoor Surveillance Footage**: Captured from outdoor-mounted cameras, the dataset reflects real-world surveillance conditions.
- **Tracking Annotations**: Each video comes with detailed tracking annotations, facilitating tasks such as object detection, tracking, and synopsis generation.
- **Multi-Purpose Utility**: While primarily intended for video synopsis, the dataset can also be used for training and evaluating object detection and tracking models in videos.
