# Video Synopsis: FGS Model

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview
Video synopsis is a powerful technique for condensing long surveillance videos into a shorter summary, where key activities are preserved. The process involves detecting and tracking objects in a video, followed by creating "object tubes"â€”sequences of frames that encapsulate the movement of a particular object over time. These object tubes are then rearranged to maximize the visibility of non-overlapping objects in each frame, resulting in a condensed version of the original video. This technique is particularly useful for applications such as security surveillance, where reviewing hours of footage quickly is crucial.

## Features
- **FGS Model**: Fast and efficient video synopsis generation.
- **Empty-Frame Object Detector**: Identifies frames without any objects to optimize the object detection process.
- **Tube Grouping Algorithm**: Maintains relationships among object tubes.
- **Greedy Tube Rearrangement**: Efficiently determines the start time for each object tube.

## SynoClip Dataset
We introduce the **SynoClip** dataset, a standard dataset specifically designed for the video synopsis task. It includes all the necessary features needed to evaluate various models directly and effectively.
